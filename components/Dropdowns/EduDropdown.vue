      The Florida State University experience is unlike any other. I have never met a group of
      people so dedicated to both their schoolwork and partying at the same time. While, I've had
      my fair share of fun at this school, my biggest takeways have been what I have learned in
      the classroom. I came into Florida State with no direction and certainly no idea what I
      wanted my professional life to look like. Through my advisors and my experiences at the
      school, I came to realize that I had a passion for computers. This has led me down the path that I have been on for almost 2 years of an obsession with programming, computers, and technology as a whole.

        Attending Christopher Columbus High School was a transformative experience. The education I
        received went well beyond just academics. A strong sense of morals and values were instilled
        in me. The school fostered a brotherhood unlike anywhere else I've been. I met some of my
        closest friends while attending Christopher Columbus and some of my best memories are from
        my time on campus. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to attend the school.
