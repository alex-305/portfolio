### Background

&emsp;My mom and dad were born & raised in Cuba but I was born and raised in Miami, Florida.
If you're not familiar with the area, Miami's culture and history is intertwined with Cuba's.
People have been immigrating from Cuba to Miami for almost a hundred years.
Because of this, the city has rich Cuban culture and amazing Cuban cuisine that I've been able to enjoy for the 21 years I've been here.
I've also been to Cuba 4 times now with the most recent time being this Summer for about 2 weeks.
It's difficult to ignore Cuba's history of human rights violations and extreme levels of poverty.
It makes me really appreciate where I live and the sacrifices my parents had to make for us to be in the United States.

### Coding

&emsp;If you know me, you know I like to code. 
I code by the pool. 
I code on the boat. 
I've been caught coding at a party.
It's something I've taken a lot of interest in because it reminds me playing with legos as a kid.
I'm not talking about the lego sets where you build a specific thing. 
I'm talking about the ones where you just get a bunch of pieces and you can make anything you can think of.
<br><br>

&emsp;So of course I had to code in Cuba.
I have a project I am really passionate about which is this website ([alexgonz.dev](alexgonz.dev)).
I'm very familiar with Vue.js & Nuxt which is a big part of my tech stack for this project.
What I'm not so familiar with is Nuxt/Content & Vuetify which are the next biggest parts of my tech stack.
This is okay when I have a stable internet connection because both technologies have great documentation.
On a very unstable connection, however, it's difficult to search for new Vuetify components and Nuxt/Content query options I want to use.
Additionally, we didn't go to Cuba to code, we came to vacation.
This meant I had limited coding opportunities.
I coded in 15 minute sessions mostly at night after going to the beach, club, bar, and various other things we did throughout our stay.

### Cuba

&emsp;Cuba is a very beautiful country. 
We stayed at a hotel in Varadero for 2 nights which is one of the most beautiful beaches in the world.
My dad grew up just 30 minutes away from the beach in nearby Matanzas. 
I've been to the beach before but it's always nice to visit it again because I know it was a big part of my dad's childhood.
We also stayed a night in Vi√±ales Valley which is a beautiful city in between the mountains.

&emsp;Cuba is a place I love and one that I definitely plan on visiting again.
Despite all the problems that Cubans face, they are some of the nicest and best people to hang out with.
It felt like everywhere we went, people wanted to make sure we were having a great time.
The service was amazing, the music was great, and the food was delicious.
